    "### Abstract:\n",
    "The aim of this project is to explore the applicability and effectiveness of the Nash Equilibrium concept in a finite non-zero-sum competitive games such as Prisoner's dilemma, Battle of the Sexes, Deadlock, etc. By analyzing various game scenarios and implementing Nash equilibrium strategies, the project seeks to prove that the mutual benefits (combined payoff) of equilibrium outcomes are superior compared to purely competitive strategies or best outcome actions in long-term finite competitive interactions. Outside of the project's scope are the cooperative scenarios and multi-level stochastic (Markov) games as these scenarios have been extensively examined in previous works."
